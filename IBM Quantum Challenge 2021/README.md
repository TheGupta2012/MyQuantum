## IBM Quantum Challenge 2021 ‚öõÔ∏è
- This year's challenge was inspired by the history of quantum computing with the problems ranging from the basic **toffoli decomposition** to the recent algorithms which involve **VQE**
- The most interesting problem for me was **problem 3** which involved some basic concepts of graph theory and quantum circuit transpilation
- While I was able to achieve almost optimal results in each problem, most importantly, it was a lot of fun to learn new concepts üí°
- I was able to solve 4 problems and gained a digital intermediate badge ü•à
