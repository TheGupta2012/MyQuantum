# IBM Quantum Challenges
### Africa 2021 
- This is a repository containing my submissions for the *Africa Quantum Challenge 2021* by IBM. 
- The 2 week challenge comprised of three major applications of Quantum computing in *agriculture, finance* and *healthcare* where the participants had to construct quantum algorithms for the same.
- I was able to solve all the three problems within the first three days of the challenge and had a lot of fun while solving the [**HIV drug simulation probelm**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TheGupta2012/MyQuantum/blob/master/IBM%20Africa%20Challenge%202021/lab3/lab3.ipynb).
- Hoping to actually learn the theory behind all the algorithms that we utilised!
