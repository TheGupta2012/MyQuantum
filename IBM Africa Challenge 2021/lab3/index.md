title: Lab 3
subtitle: Quantum Chemistry for HIV
---

HIV has affected many communities, especially in Africa. Though there has been significant research into treatments for the disease, there is still a lot of work to be done. Quantum computers have the promise of revolutionising the way we discover drugs and how we treat illnesses. This lab takes you through a demonstration of calculating whether a given drug would block the binding ability of the viral protein. Using advanced quantum algorithms and cutting-edge research, you will learn how to model and simulate the molecular interaction between the virus and a hypothetical drug.
