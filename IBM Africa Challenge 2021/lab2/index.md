subtitle: Quantum Speedups in Finance

There is significant promise in applying quantum computing to the field of finance. One important financial computation is predicting the future price of derivative contracts, or options. The dynamics of the African financial markets are complicated and different to the rest of the world, increasing the complexity of models for predictions in this field. In this lab, you will learn how to construct a model for a QuantumTech share and calculate its expected value over a certain number of days, using both classical and quantum approaches.
