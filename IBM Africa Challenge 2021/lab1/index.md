title: Lab 1
subtitle: Introduction and the Crop-Yield Problem
---

In this lab, you will be introduced to quantum computing at a high level with Qiskit. This includes how to set up your problem definition as a quadratic program. To illustrate this, you will solve a simple agricultural optimization problem on the choice of crops for a farm, with the goal of increasing the yield. This lab focuses on access to food, an important problem for Africa, to guide you through your first steps in quantum computing.
