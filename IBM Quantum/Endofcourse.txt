Hey everyone I am Harshit from Delhi, India
I'm an UG in CS and I've been learning QC through Qubit by Qubit for the past 10 months.

Before Qubit by Qubit, I had just heard of the term Quantum Computing as some future technology, yet to be realised in daily life, but qubit by qubit helped bring that into perspective. It gave me a platform to not only learn QC in an extremely welcoming environment but also network with some of the most passionate people in the field.

I hope that I am related to quantum for years to come and it is all through this wonderful initiative by IBM and the Coding School. 
Will miss it a lot! Thank you, Qubit by Qubit.
