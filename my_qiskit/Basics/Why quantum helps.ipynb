    "- Using quantum we hope to find solutions to the problems which are very difficult to deal with on the classical computers.\n",
    "- Quantum computers may provide a very big advantage when **a search space needs to be analysed** and no optimization is possible for the classical computers.\n",
    "- For example, if we want to find the value of some parameter x for which some function f(x) is a minimum, or the period of the function if f(x) is periodic.\n",
    "- **CLASSICAL** : f(x) computed for a variety of inputs and then the global property is analysed.\n",
    "- **QUANTUM** : With quantum, our input can be in a superposition of ALL THE POSSIBLE INPUTS which can be applied simultaneously. \n",
    "Although we know that we only will get a SINGLE MEASURED OUTCOME, but the PROBABIILITY of getting the correct solution actually would help you to MEASURE RIGHT WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY.\n",
    "- Quantum computers are very good at solving quantum systems for which memory requirements actually scale linearly for a quantum computer but exponentially for a classical one\n",
