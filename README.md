# My Quantum :bulb:
This is a repository to keep up my current progress on IBM's Introduction to Quantum Computing course and my independent learnings through the **qiskit-textbook** and, well, stuff.
### Quantum Mechanics 
> Current
- I am currently studying *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang. It is considered to be **the** go to book for this computing paradigm but its tougher than expected :sweat_smile:. Let's see!
### Quantum Computation
> Current
- I am currently learning from the amazing course offered by [IBM](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/MyQuantum/tree/master/IBM%20Quantum) and doing a little bit of self learning from *qiskit-textbook*. [This](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/MyQuantum/tree/master/my_qiskit) is what I have so far :crossed_fingers:
- Started a new blog on my learnings which goes by the name of **The Uncertainist** because, let's be honest, you can't be so sure of yourself while learning quantum :exploding_head: ! Anyway its just an attempt at understanding things better little by little
