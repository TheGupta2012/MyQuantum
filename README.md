# My Quantum :bulb:
This is a repository to keep up my current progress on IBM's Introduction to Quantum Computing course and my independent learnings through the **qiskit-textbook** and, well, stuff.
### Quantum Mechanics 
> Current
- I am currently studying *Quantum Mechanics : The Theoretical Minimum* by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman. It is an introductory book to get started with quantum mechanics for people comfortable with mathematics, only it :sweat_smile:
### Quantum Computation
> Current
- I am currently learning from the amazing course offered by [IBM](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/MyQuantum/tree/master/IBM%20Quantum) and doing a little bit of self learning from *qiskit-textbook*. [This](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/MyQuantum/tree/master/my_qiskit) is what I have so far :crossed_fingers:
